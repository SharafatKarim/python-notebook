# Python & Data Science Notebook

[![Made with MyST](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-myst-orange)](https://myst.tools)

Welcome to my Python notebook! Here, I document my experiments, learning, and insights as I explore Python and the world of data! This notebook includes,

- Python basics
- Numerical methods
- Data analysis techniques
- Visualization examples
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning concepts
- Simulations and modeling

## About This Project

This notebook is built using [Jupyter Book](https://next.jupyterbook.org/) and leverages the power of [MyST Markdown](https://myst.tools) for enhanced documentation and interactivity. MyST enables rich formatting, executable code blocks, and seamless integration with Jupyter notebooks.

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SharafatKarim/python-notebook
  cd python-notebook
  ```

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

1. **Install required packages:**

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

1. **Initialize Jupyter Book:**

  ```bash
  jupyter-book start
  ```

  It'll open a live server where you can view and interact with the notebook. Usually, it runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
