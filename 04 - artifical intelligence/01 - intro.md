## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. Python is a popular language for AI development due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries.

For starters we will start with basic algorithms...

## Installation

Besides python, we may need to install,

- `numpy`: for numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: for plotting and visualization
